      <h3>What is this tool used for?</h3>
        <p>This tool was developed by me under the course of two days because I needed a way to preview the dialogue I was writing in OoT decomp, this tool exculsively previews the text, and is not a text editor for the game, this may change in the future, but for now it is strictly used to get a general idea of what the text boxes will look like in game.</p>
